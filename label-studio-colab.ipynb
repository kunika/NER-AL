    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Code in Google Colaboratory (Colab) is executed in a virtual machine allocated to your Google account on a temporary basis with limited lifetime e.g. up to 12 hours for the free version. Whenever the maximum lifetime is reached or you close your notebook, any data generated by your code is deleted and the virtual machine is recycled and re-allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means when running Label Studio in Colab is that Label Studio's data folder (where its database, your data, project settings and annotations are stored) is deleted when your time is up or you close this notebook. After this point, when you launch Label Studio, you will be creating a fresh instance with a fresh database and settings, and therefore:\n",
    "* You will need to create a new user account for logging into Label Studio.\n",
    "* Your previous annotations and any unannotated data will need to be imported back into Label Studio, and your projects and labels re-created and re-configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-time use\n",
    "\n",
    "For one-time use, make sure to save your annotations using Label Studio's export function, ideally in both CSV and JSON formats (note: relations, meta text (notes), review comments and other meta data are only exported in the JSON format). \n",

    "### Continuous use\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous use, there are a couple of workarounds to make Label Studio's database and settings persist across Colab sessions and runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workaround 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "When launching Label Studio, specify a folder in your Google Drive to use as the data folder. This will allow the data folder to persist across Colab sessions and runtime.\n",
    "1. Create a folder named 'label-studio' within your Google Drive.\n",
    "1. Mount your Google Drive (see below).\n",
    "1. In the left side of this notebook, open the Files pane and expand the file tree and navigate to the destination folder in your Google Drive. Right click on the folder and select `Copy path`.\n",
    "1. When launching Label Studio, use the `--data-dir` option e.g.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   label-studio --data-dir <paste your path here>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "Note: If your path contains any spaces, wrap it in between quotes e.g. `\"/content/drive/MyDrive/folk songs/annotation/label-studio\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workaround 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you close this notebook, take a copy Label Studio's data folder located at `/root/.local/share/label-studio` and save it to your Google Drive or download it. Then, before you spin up Label Studio again, copy the data folder back to `/root/.local/share/label-studio`.\n",
    "1. Create a folder named 'label-studio' within your Google Drive.\n",
    "1. Mount your Google Drive (see below).\n",
    "1. In the left side of this notebook, open the Files pane and expand the file tree and navigate to the destination folder in your Google Drive. Right click on the folder and select `Copy path`.\n",
    "1. In a new cell, create a new terminal:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   %load_ext colabxterm\n",
    "   %xterm\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "1. To copy Label Studio's data folder to your Google Drive:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   cp -r /root/.local/share/label-studio <paste your path here>\n",
    "   ```\n",
